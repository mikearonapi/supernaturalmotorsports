    fullDescription: `A cold air intake replaces your car's stock airbox with a larger, less restrictive system that draws cooler air from outside the engine bay. Cold air is denser, meaning more oxygen molecules per gulp, which allows for more efficient combustion and more power.`,

    shortDescription: 'Drop-in replacement filter with better flow than stock',
    fullDescription: `A high-flow air filter is a direct replacement for your factory filter that allows more air to pass through while still filtering contaminants. Brands like K&N and AEM offer reusable filters that can be cleaned and re-oiled.`,

    howItWorks: 'The intake manifold distributes air from the throttle body to each cylinder. Performance manifolds use larger, straighter runners and optimized plenum designs to improve airflow velocity and volume.',
