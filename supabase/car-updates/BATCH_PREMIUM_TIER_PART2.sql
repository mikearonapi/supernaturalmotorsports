  essence = 'The last Lotus with a combustion engine—a mid-engine masterpiece that proves you don''t need 600 horsepower to have the ultimate driving experience.',
  heritage = E'The Emira represents Lotus'' final statement on internal combustion before transitioning to electric vehicles. It''s the culmination of everything Colin Chapman''s company learned about making cars that prioritize driving engagement above all else.\n\nBuilt on an all-new aluminum platform, the Emira offers two engine choices: a Toyota-sourced 3.5L supercharged V6 (from the Evora) or a Mercedes-AMG 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder. Both deliver the lightweight, connected driving experience that defines Lotus.\n\nThe Emira is more refined than any previous Lotus—it has actual interior quality, functional technology, and build quality that approaches mainstream sports cars. Yet it retained the purity of purpose that made Lotus special.',
  design_philosophy = E'Lotus'' philosophy has always been "simplify, then add lightness." The Emira applies this to a modern context—what''s the minimum car needed for maximum driving pleasure?\n\nAt roughly 3,000 pounds, it''s lighter than nearly every competitor. The mid-engine layout and hydraulic steering prioritize driver feedback. The suspension is tuned for communication, not isolation.\n\nWhere modern sports cars add weight for features and power to compensate, the Emira proves the old ways still work. Sometimes less really is more.',
  motorsport_history = 'While the Emira itself is too new for significant racing history, it inherits Lotus'' DNA from decades of motorsport success. The Evora GT4 racing program proved the platform''s capability, and the Emira GT4 race car continues this tradition.',

  engine_character = E'Two distinct characters:\n\nThe V6: The 3.5L supercharged Toyota unit revs to 7,000 RPM with a mechanical howl that builds intensity. Supercharger whine adds character without turbo lag. Power delivery is linear and predictable.\n\nThe I4: The AMG 2.0L turbo makes more power (360hp vs 400hp) with a different character. More torque, faster acceleration, but less emotional engagement. The turbo provides instant boost with minimal lag.\n\nBoth engines reward drivers who explore the rev range. The V6 is the enthusiast choice; the I4 is the performance choice.',
  transmission_feel = E'Manual only with the V6—a six-speed with light, precise throws that''s perfectly matched to the engine''s character. This is the transmission for purists.\n\nThe AMG I4 pairs exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic. Quick shifts, intelligent programming, but you lose the manual connection.\n\nThe V6 manual combination is why most enthusiasts choose the Emira.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'This is where the Emira shines. The aluminum chassis is stiff and light, providing exceptional feedback. Turn-in is immediate, rotation is adjustable, and the mid-engine balance creates confidence at the limit.\n\nThe suspension is compliant enough for real roads—this isn''t a track-only tool—but communicative enough that you always know what the tires are doing. It''s the Goldilocks balance Lotus perfected over decades.\n\nWeight distribution is near-perfect at 42/58 front/rear. The car telegraphs its limits clearly and rewards skilled inputs.',
  steering_feel = E'Hydraulic power steering—increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. The Emira''s steering is its calling card: quick ratio, genuine feedback, perfect weighting.\n\nYou feel the road surface, the tire loading, the exact moment grip begins to fade. This is what steering is supposed to be. Modern electric systems don''t come close.\n\nThe steering alone justifies choosing the Emira over heavier, more powerful alternatives.',
  brake_confidence = E'AP Racing brakes with excellent feel and fade resistance. Pedal is firm and progressive with strong initial bite.\n\nFor track use, the brakes are capable of extended sessions without drama. Optional carbon-ceramics available for those seeking maximum performance.',
  sound_signature = E'The V6 with sport exhaust produces a distinctive supercharged howl—mechanical and engaging without being obnoxious. The supercharger whine adds character under acceleration.\n\nThe AMG I4 has a different voice—more growl, less howl. Respectable but not as emotionally engaging as the V6.\n\nNeither sounds like anything else on the road. The Lotus character is distinct.',
  comfort_track_balance = 'weekend',
  comfort_notes = E'More refined than any previous Lotus. The interior has actual quality materials, the infotainment works (mostly), and road noise is manageable for a sports car.\n\nIt''s still firm by mainstream standards—this is a Lotus, not a GT car. But for weekend driving and occasional long trips, it''s genuinely usable. Previous Lotus models were compromised; the Emira is merely focused.',

After being cancelled in 2010, enthusiast demand brought it back with modern refinements while keeping the raw character intact.\n\nThis generation finally got proper safety features, electronic stability control, and a more refined interior. But the formula remained pure: naturally aspirated V10, manual transmission only, rear-wheel drive, and absolutely no hybrid assistance.\n\nThe ACR version became a legend, setting production car lap records at multiple tracks including a 7:01 Nürburgring time. It proved that American muscle could compete with European precision—with enough talent behind the wheel.',
  design_philosophy = E'The Viper''s philosophy never changed: maximum displacement, maximum power, minimum electronic intervention. The Gen 5 added sophistication without diluting the experience.\n\nSRT''s engineers focused on making the car faster and safer while preserving its analog character. Stability control was finally added—but could be completely disabled. The interior was upgraded—but the driving position remained purposeful.\n\nThis is a car that demands respect and rewards skill. It won''t save you from mistakes, but it''ll take you places no other production car can go.',
