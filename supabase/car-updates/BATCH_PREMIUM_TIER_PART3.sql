  heritage = E'The MK4 Supra is Japan''s most iconic sports car and arguably the most famous Japanese car of all time. Powered by the legendary 2JZ-GTE twin-turbo inline-six, it combined Toyota reliability with genuine supercar performance.\n\nWhen introduced in 1993, the twin-turbo Supra produced 320 horsepower (Japan claimed)—actually closer to 280 at the crank with 320+ at the wheels according to many dyno tests. The engine was famously overbuilt, capable of handling 1,000+ horsepower with basic modifications.\n\nFast & Furious launched the Supra into cultural immortality, but enthusiasts already knew what they had. The combination of bulletproof engineering, stunning capability, and endless modification potential made it legendary. Production ended in 2002, and values have never stopped climbing.',
  design_philosophy = E'Toyota''s engineers designed the A80 Supra to compete with Porsche and Ferrari. They succeeded by applying Japanese engineering discipline to supercar performance targets.\n\nThe 2JZ engine was massively overengineered—cast iron block, forged internals, efficient twin-turbo setup. It could handle double its stock power with stock internals. This wasn''t accidental; Toyota built in headroom for evolution.\n\nThe chassis was equally competent: perfect 53/47 weight distribution, double-wishbone suspension all around, and Getrag six-speed manual transmission. It was designed for the autobahn, built to Toyota standards.',
  motorsport_history = 'The Supra dominated JGTC (Japanese GT Championship) throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. In drag racing, 2JZ-powered cars have set countless records. The engine''s reliability under extreme stress made it the tuner''s choice worldwide.',

  successors = '["Toyota GR Supra A90 (2019+)"]'::jsonb,

  engine_character = E'The 2JZ-GTE is an engineering marvel. The twin-turbo inline-six builds power progressively with virtually no lag, pulling strong from 3,000 RPM and screaming to the 6,800 RPM redline.\n\nStock, it makes somewhere between 280-320 horsepower depending on whose numbers you believe. More importantly, it''s capable of 1,000+ horsepower with bolt-on modifications and basic internal work. The bottom end is essentially unbreakable.\n\nThe power delivery is smooth and relentless—very different from peaky import competitors. It feels like a well-engineered machine rather than a high-strung race engine.',
  transmission_feel = E'The Getrag V160 six-speed manual is strong enough to handle serious power and smooth enough for daily driving. Shifts are precise with medium throws and a satisfying mechanical engagement.\n\nThe automatic (W58) should be avoided—it can''t handle significant power increases and lacks the engagement that makes the Supra special. Manual cars command massive premiums and are the only choice for enthusiasts.\n\nThe clutch is heavy by modern standards but progressive and communicative.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'The Supra''s chassis is often overlooked amid the engine worship, but it''s genuinely excellent. Double-wishbone suspension all around provides precise geometry and excellent feedback.\n\nWeight distribution is nearly perfect at 53/47. The car rotates willingly with throttle lift and can be balanced through corners with subtle inputs. It''s not as raw as a 911, but it''s more communicative than most GTs.\n\nThe car is large and heavy (3,400+ lbs) but never feels clumsy. It''s a grand tourer that can embarrass sports cars when pushed.',
  steering_feel = E'Hydraulic power steering with good feedback. Not the razor-sharp communication of a Lotus, but appropriate for the GT character. You know what the front tires are doing.\n\nThe steering is one area where age shows—bushings wear and introduce slack. Refreshed examples feel significantly better than neglected ones.',
  brake_confidence = E'Stock brakes are adequate for street driving but show their age on track. The car is heavy and fast—brake upgrades are common for track use.\n\nPedal feel is firm and progressive. For street driving, stock brakes are fine with quality pads.',
  sound_signature = E'The 2JZ has a distinctive turbo inline-six sound—smooth, mechanical, with turbo whistle and blow-off valve sounds that defined a generation of import culture.\n\nStock exhaust is quiet. Most examples have aftermarket systems that range from subtle to obnoxious. A quality exhaust reveals the engine''s character without being antisocial.\n\nThis is what turbocharged performance sounded like before twin-scroll sophistication made everything sound similar.',
  comfort_track_balance = 'daily',
  comfort_notes = E'The Supra is genuinely comfortable for a performance car. The seats are supportive for long drives, the ride is compliant (if firm), and the cabin is quiet at cruise.\n\nThe targa top (most US models) allows open-air driving. Climate control works well. Visibility is good. It''s a grand tourer that happens to be extremely fast.\n\nAs a 25+ year old car, interior materials show their age. But the fundamental comfort is there.',

  heritage = E'The GT3 badge represents Porsche''s commitment to driver-focused engineering. Since its introduction in 1999, the GT3 has been the 911 for enthusiasts who prioritize involvement over comfort.\n\nThe 997 generation (2007-2011) refined the formula: 3.6L (997.1) or 3.8L (997.2) flat-six, naturally aspirated to 8,400 RPM, rear-wheel drive, and available only with manual transmission. This was a car designed for the track that remained street-legal.\n\nThe GT3 RS versions pushed further—more power, less weight, adjustable suspension. They were as close to race cars as Porsche dared make road-legal. Today, these cars are recognized as among the greatest driver''s 911s ever built.',
  design_philosophy = E'The GT3''s philosophy is simple: everything in service of driving engagement. The naturally aspirated engine delivers linear, predictable power. The manual transmission puts the driver in complete control. The chassis is tuned for feedback, not isolation.\n\nWhere the Turbo adds technology to make speed easy, the GT3 strips complexity to make speed pure. There''s no turbos to manage, no all-wheel drive to distribute torque. It''s you, a flat-six, and the road.\n\nThe RS versions took this further—deleting weight wherever possible, adding adjustable suspension, and cranking power higher. They''re the ultimate expression of the GT3 philosophy.',
  motorsport_history = 'The 997 GT3 served as the basis for the GT3 Cup and GT3 RSR racing programs. The GT3 Cup was (and remains) the largest single-marque racing series in the world. The road car''s track credentials are not marketing—they''re verified in competition.',

  engine_character = E'The Mezger-derived flat-six is legendary. It revs to 8,400 RPM with a mechanical intensity that modern engines can''t match. Power builds linearly, rewarding those who use the entire rev range.\n\nThe 997.2 GT3 produced 435hp from 3.8 liters—naturally aspirated. The RS versions pushed to 450hp. This is significant power achieved through engineering rather than boost.\n\nThe intake howl at high RPM is intoxicating. The engine begs to be revved. This is what naturally aspirated engines should be.',
  transmission_feel = E'Manual only—Porsche never offered PDK on the 997 GT3. The six-speed is perfectly matched to the engine, with short throws and satisfying mechanical engagement.\n\nShift quality is excellent. Rev-matching is available on later cars but can be disabled. For purists, the manual-only approach is essential to the GT3''s character.\n\nThe clutch is heavier than a Carrera''s but progressive and communicative. It''s designed for track use while remaining livable on the street.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'The GT3 chassis is the benchmark for driver communication. Turn-in is immediate, rotation is adjustable, and the car telegraphs its limits clearly. The rear-engine layout provides tremendous traction on corner exit.\n\nThe suspension is firm but not punishing for a track-focused car. RS models have adjustable dampers for fine-tuning. The chassis rewards aggressive driving while remaining approachable.\n\nBody roll is minimal. Weight transfer is predictable. This is the chassis that professional drivers use as their reference point.',
  steering_feel = E'Hydraulic power steering with exceptional feedback. You feel the road surface, the tire loading, the exact moment of breakaway. The 997 GT3''s steering is often cited as the benchmark for sports car feel.\n\nWeighting is linear and progressive. The steering is quick without being nervous. This is communication—the car talks to you through your fingertips.',
  brake_confidence = E'Track-ready brakes with excellent stopping power and fade resistance. PCCB (carbon-ceramic) was optional and recommended for track use.\n\nPedal feel is firm and progressive. The brakes inspire confidence under repeated hard use. For a car designed for track days, this is essential.',
  sound_signature = E'The Mezger-derived flat-six has a distinctive sound that''s mechanical, intense, and pure. It''s not as loud as an American V8 or as exotic as an Italian V8, but it''s uniquely Porsche.\n\nThe intake howl at 8,000+ RPM is addictive. The exhaust note is purposeful without being obnoxious. Everything sounds expensive and engineered.\n\nThe optional sport exhaust adds volume for those who want more drama.',
  comfort_track_balance = 'track-focused',
  comfort_notes = E'Let''s be honest: the GT3 is not comfortable by normal standards. The suspension is firm, road noise is present, and the cabin is spartan compared to a Carrera.\n\nBut for a track-focused car, it''s remarkably livable. You can drive it every day if you accept the compromises. Many owners do exactly that.\n\nThe RS models are more extreme—fixed bucket seats, lightweight construction, even less sound insulation. Daily driving is possible but challenging.',
