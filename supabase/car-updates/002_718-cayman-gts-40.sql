  heritage = E'The GTS badge has always represented Porsche''s driver-focused road cars—more capable than standard models but more livable than full GT variants. The 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 perfects this formula.\n\nWhen Porsche introduced the turbocharged four-cylinder 718 in 2016, enthusiasts mourned the loss of the flat-six. The GTS 4.0, introduced in 2020, was Porsche''s direct response: the same 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-six from the GT4, slightly detuned for better low-end response and paired with a more compliant chassis.\n\nThe result is a car that sounds like a GT4, performs like a GT4 on canyon roads, but won''t punish you on the daily commute. It''s the enthusiast''s compromise—and perhaps the most complete sports car Porsche makes.',
  design_philosophy = E'Where the GT4 was designed for track performance above all else, the GTS 4.0 was engineered to be the ultimate road car within the 718 platform.\n\nPorsche''s engineers retained the emotional elements—the naturally aspirated flat-six, the manual transmission option, the connected steering feel—while calibrating everything for varied road surfaces rather than smooth circuits. The adaptive dampers offer genuine range between comfortable cruising and aggressive canyon carving.\n\nThe philosophy is simple: what would the perfect Cayman feel like if you never intended to track it? The GTS 4.0 is that answer.',

  -- Driving Experience
  engine_character = E'The same 4.0L flat-six as the GT4, but with a subtly different calibration that improves low-RPM response at the expense of 20 peak horsepower.\n\nIn practice, the difference is nearly imperceptible on the street. The engine still rewards revs with a glorious wail, still pulls cleanly to 8,000 RPM, and still delivers the mechanical honesty that turbocharged engines can''t match. The slight torque bump below 4,000 RPM actually makes it more pleasant in traffic.\n\nThis is an engine you drive with your right foot and your ears. Every blip, every downshift, every run to redline feels special.',
  transmission_feel = E'The six-speed manual is identical to the GT4''s unit—short throws, perfect weighting, immensely satisfying engagement. It''s one of the best manual gearboxes in any modern car.\n\nThe clutch is lighter than the GT4''s, making it more suited to stop-and-go traffic. Rev-matching is standard but can be disabled. For those who appreciate the craft of driving, this manual is reason enough to choose the GTS over competitors.\n\nThe PDK is also excellent—quick shifts, intelligent programming, and no torque converter slush. But the manual is the soul of this car.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'This is where the GTS 4.0 distinguishes itself from the GT4. The suspension is compliant without being soft, controlled without being harsh. It''s the difference between a scalpel and a Swiss army knife—both are sharp, but one is more versatile.\n\nThe adaptive PASM dampers offer genuine range. In Normal mode, the ride is surprisingly civilized for a mid-engine sports car. In Sport mode, body roll tightens up and the car feels ready to attack. Neither mode compromises the mid-engine balance that makes the Cayman special.\n\nOn a twisty road, the GTS 4.0 is every bit as engaging as the GT4—you just won''t arrive with a sore back.',
  steering_feel = E'Identical to the GT4: quick ratio, genuine feedback, progressive weighting. The electric power steering rack is among the best in the industry.\n\nYou feel the road surface, the tire loading through corners, and the exact moment grip begins to fade. It''s not quite hydraulic-era feel, but it''s closer than almost any modern car achieves.\n\nThe steering alone makes this car worth driving.',
  brake_confidence = E'Smaller rotors than the GT4 (350mm vs 380mm front) but more than adequate for spirited road driving. The pedal feel is firm and progressive with excellent modulation.\n\nFor occasional track use, the stock brakes are sufficient for 15-20 minute sessions before fade becomes noticeable. Serious track rats should look at the GT4, but the GTS handles the occasional HPDE day without drama.\n\nOptional PCCB ceramic brakes are available but rarely necessary for the GTS''s intended use case.',
  sound_signature = E'Indistinguishable from the GT4. The same flat-six bark at idle, the same rising howl through the midrange, the same mechanical scream at redline.\n\nThis is the reason to choose the GTS 4.0 over the turbocharged base models. No synthesized engine notes, no fake exhaust pops—just pure mechanical music.\n\nThe optional sports exhaust adds volume and crackle on overrun. Many owners consider it essential.',
  comfort_track_balance = 'weekend',
  comfort_notes = E'The GTS 4.0 is a genuine daily driver in a way the GT4 isn''t. The adaptive dampers in Normal mode absorb rough pavement gracefully. Road noise is present but not intrusive. The standard sport seats (not fixed buckets) offer comfort for long drives.\n\nClimate control is effective, visibility is good, and the driving position is excellent. You could commute in this car without complaint—something that''s harder to say about the GT4.\n\nIt''s still a mid-engine sports car with limited cargo space, but within those constraints, it''s remarkably livable.',
