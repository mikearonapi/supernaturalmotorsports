  essence = 'The everyday supercar that proved Audi could play in Ferrari''s sandbox—a V8 masterpiece that democratized the exotic car experience.',
  heritage = E'The R8 was Audi''s moonshot—a mid-engine supercar from a brand known for sensible sedans. Launched in 2007, it shared its aluminum spaceframe with the Lamborghini Gallardo but carved its own identity with understated German design and genuine daily usability.\n\nThe 4.2L FSI V8, borrowed from the RS4, delivered 420 horsepower with Audi reliability. Unlike Italian exotics, the R8 started every time, had functional climate control, and wouldn''t strand you at cars and coffee.\n\nTony Stark''s choice in Iron Man cemented its cultural status. The R8 proved you could have supercar performance without supercar drama—a revolutionary concept that changed how we think about exotic cars.',
  design_philosophy = E'Audi''s engineers wanted to build a supercar you could actually use. Every decision prioritized real-world functionality alongside exotic performance.\n\nThe aluminum spaceframe was stiff and light. The V8 sat behind the driver, low enough to see over in the mirror. The dashboard was driver-focused but not intimidating. The trunk actually held luggage.\n\nThe result was a car that felt special without feeling fragile—exotic in character but German in execution.',

  engine_character = E'The 4.2L FSI V8 is a high-revving, naturally aspirated gem. It spins to 8,250 RPM with a mechanical wail that''s distinctly different from Italian or American V8s.\n\nPower delivery is linear and predictable—no turbo lag, no sudden power spikes. It pulls strongly from 4,000 RPM to redline with increasing intensity. The dry-sump oiling allows the engine to sit low, improving handling.\n\nThis is an engine built to reward drivers who use the entire rev range.',
  transmission_feel = E'The gated six-speed manual is the transmission to have. The open gate with exposed mechanism is theater every time you shift. Throws are medium-length with a satisfying mechanical engagement.\n\nAvoid the R-tronic single-clutch automated manual—it''s jerky at low speeds and has reliability issues. If you must have two pedals, find a later car with the S-tronic dual-clutch.\n\nManual R8s command significant premiums and are increasingly rare.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'Mid-engine balance with Quattro all-wheel drive creates a unique character—stable at the limit but still engaging. Turn-in is immediate, and the car rotates willingly once you learn to trust the chassis.\n\nThe aluminum spaceframe is incredibly stiff, providing excellent feedback. Optional magnetic ride dampers transform the ride—compliant in comfort mode, tight in sport. Without them, the fixed suspension is firm but not punishing.\n\nIt''s more accessible than rear-drive Italian exotics while still rewarding skilled drivers.',
  steering_feel = E'Hydraulic power steering with genuine road feel. Weight builds naturally with speed, and you can feel the front tires working through corners.\n\nThe steering is one of the R8''s defining characteristics—it''s a direct line to understanding what the chassis is doing. Modern electric systems rarely match this level of communication.',
  brake_confidence = E'Carbon-ceramic brakes were optional; most cars have steel rotors. Both systems provide strong, fade-resistant stopping power with excellent pedal feel.\n\nFor track use, the carbon-ceramics are worth having. For street driving, steel brakes are perfectly adequate and far cheaper to maintain.',
  sound_signature = E'A distinctive V8 howl that''s mechanical and sophisticated—more precision instrument than muscle car rumble. The high-revving character creates a sound that builds intensity with RPM.\n\nAt idle, it burbles quietly. At full throttle to 8,000+ RPM, it screams. The optional sport exhaust adds volume without becoming obnoxious.\n\nIt won''t shake buildings like an American V8, but it sounds expensive and exotic.',

  ownership_cost_notes = 'True exotic ownership costs. Budget $8-15K annually. E-gear maintenance is expensive and unavoidable. Find a Lamborghini specialist—don''t trust general mechanics.',

  essence = 'The Lamborghini that changed everything—the first "accessible" raging bull that proved Italian exotics could be (somewhat) reliable while delivering pure, unfiltered supercar drama.',
  heritage = E'The Gallardo saved Lamborghini. After years of low-volume, unreliable exotics, the Gallardo arrived in 2003 as the brand''s first "entry-level" supercar—designed to compete with Ferrari''s 360 and be produced in actual volume.\n\nWith Audi ownership came German engineering discipline. The Gallardo used an aluminum spaceframe and a new 5.0L V10 (later upgraded to 5.2L). It was the first Lamborghini with genuine build quality and the first that regular people might actually be able to own.\n\nOver its decade-long production run, Lamborghini sold over 14,000 Gallardos—more than all previous Lamborghini models combined. It established the "baby Lambo" formula that continues with the Huracán today.',
  design_philosophy = E'The Gallardo was designed to deliver maximum Lamborghini drama while being possible to live with. Compared to the Murciélago, it was smaller, lighter, and crucially, more reliable.\n\nGerman engineering from parent company Audi brought structural rigidity, better build quality, and more sophisticated manufacturing. But the design remained pure Lamborghini—dramatic angles, aggressive stance, and presence that makes crowds stop.\n\nThe result was a car that looked like a poster on every kid''s wall but could actually survive daily use.',
  motorsport_history = 'The Gallardo has extensive racing history. The Super Trofeo one-make series, GT3 racing, and various privateer efforts proved the platform''s capability. The Gallardo LP570-4 Super Trofeo Stradale was a road-legal race car.',
  generation_code = 'L140',
  predecessors = '["Lamborghini Jalpa (loosely)"]'::jsonb,
  successors = '["Lamborghini Huracán (2014+)"]'::jsonb,

  engine_character = E'The V10 is pure emotion. From 2009 onward, the 5.2L unit produces 552 horsepower (LP560-4) with a sound that''s unmistakably Lamborghini—an angry, mechanical roar that transforms every tunnel into a concert hall.\n\nThe naturally aspirated response is immediate and violent. No turbo lag, no gradual build—just instant throttle response and a relentless pull to the 8,500 RPM redline.\n\nEarlier 5.0L cars (2004-2008) make 493-520hp and have slightly different character but the same emotional impact. Either engine rewards those who use the full rev range.',
  transmission_feel = E'Two transmission choices: the E-gear automated manual or the traditional gated six-speed manual.\n\nThe manual is the choice for purists—exposed gate, satisfying throws, full control. These cars command significant premiums and avoid E-gear reliability concerns. Every shift is theater.\n\nE-gear is faster on paper but jerky at low speeds and has known reliability issues. The hydraulic pump fails, clutches wear quickly, and actuators need attention. If buying E-gear, budget for maintenance—and consider manual conversion.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'Mid-engine, all-wheel-drive dynamics with genuine Lamborghini aggression. The Gallardo rotates willingly once you commit, with progressive and communicative handling at the limit.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system (on LP560-4 and most variants) provides tremendous traction and stability. Rear-wheel-drive variants (LP550-2, LP570-4 Superleggera) are more playful but require more skill.\n\nBody roll is minimal, turn-in is sharp, and the car rewards aggressive driving. It''s not as forgiving as an Audi R8 but not as treacherous as older Italian exotics.',
  steering_feel = E'Hydraulic power steering with real feedback. The Gallardo tells you what the front tires are doing, weights up naturally with speed, and provides the confidence to push hard.\n\nThis is genuine supercar steering—quick, communicative, and involving. Modern electric systems rarely match this level of feel.',
  brake_confidence = E'Carbon-ceramic brakes were standard on many variants and optional on others. Stopping power is tremendous—this car will out-brake almost anything on the road.\n\nPedal feel is firm and progressive. Track use reveals fade resistance better than most competitors. For a decade-old Italian exotic, the brakes inspire genuine confidence.',
  sound_signature = E'The V10''s sound is the primary reason to buy this car. It''s raw, aggressive, and distinctly Lamborghini—a mechanical scream that announces your presence and raises the pulse of everyone within earshot.\n\nAt idle, it burbles with menace. At 5,000 RPM, it howls. At redline, it screams in a way that makes prancing horses seem tame. This is the sound of childhood dreams.\n\nThe optional sport exhaust (or aftermarket alternatives) unleashes even more volume. Neighbors may complain. Worth it.',
  comfort_track_balance = 'weekend',
  comfort_notes = E'Let''s be honest: this is not a comfortable car by normal standards. The suspension is firm, road noise is present, visibility is limited, and the E-gear can be frustrating in traffic.\n\nBut for a supercar of this era, it''s surprisingly livable. Climate control works, the seats are supportive for long drives, and the build quality is better than previous Lamborghinis.\n\nThis is a weekend warrior that can handle occasional daily duties—not a daily driver that happens to be fast.',
