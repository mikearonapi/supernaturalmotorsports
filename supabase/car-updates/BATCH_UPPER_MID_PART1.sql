  essence = 'America''s mid-engine revolution—a supercar-slayer that rewrote the rules by delivering exotic performance at Camaro prices.',
  heritage = E'The C8 represents the most significant change in Corvette history. After 67 years of front-engine tradition, Chevrolet finally moved the engine behind the driver—a decision debated internally since Zora Arkus-Duntov proposed it in the 1960s.\n\nThe result silenced critics immediately. With a 0-60 time under 3 seconds, handling that rivals cars costing three times as much, and a starting price under $60K, the C8 democratized supercar performance. It wasn''t just a good Corvette—it was a world-class sports car.\n\nThe mid-engine layout transformed the Corvette from muscle car to genuine exotic competitor. Ferrari, McLaren, and Porsche suddenly had to acknowledge an American interloper in their territory.',
  design_philosophy = E'GM''s engineers had one mandate: build the best Corvette ever, regardless of tradition. The mid-engine layout was the key to unlocking performance that front-engine physics couldn''t achieve.\n\nThe result prioritizes weight distribution, aerodynamics, and cooling. The 6.2L LT2 V8 sits low and central. The dual-clutch transmission handles power efficiently. The aluminum frame is stiff and light.\n\nUnlike previous Corvettes, the C8 was designed from scratch for this layout. It''s not a converted front-engine car—it''s purpose-built.',
  motorsport_history = 'The C8.R race car has competed successfully in IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. The road car''s racing DNA is genuine, derived from the same engineering that created the competition version.',

  engine_character = E'The 6.2L LT2 pushrod V8 produces 495 horsepower with the Z51 package. It''s a thoroughly modern interpretation of the classic American V8—responsive, torquey, and surprisingly efficient.\n\nPower delivery is immediate thanks to the dry-sump oiling system. The engine revs willingly to 6,500 RPM with a mechanical character that turbocharged competitors can''t match.\n\nThis is an engine that sounds like America and performs like Europe.',
  transmission_feel = E'The 8-speed dual-clutch transmission is the C8''s only option—no manual available. Shifts are lightning-fast in Track mode, smooth and intelligent in Tour mode.\n\nThe lack of manual is controversial, but the DCT''s performance justifies the decision. It''s quicker than any driver could shift manually, and it handles the V8''s torque without complaint.\n\nPaddle shifters are responsive. The transmission adapts to driving style.',
  chassis_dynamics = E'The mid-engine layout transforms Corvette handling. Turn-in is immediate, rotation is progressive, and the rear-engine weight provides excellent traction on corner exit.\n\nThe Magnetic Ride Control (Z51) provides remarkable range—compliant in Tour mode, aggressive in Track mode. The car is approachable at its limits while still rewarding aggressive driving.\n\nThis isn''t just good for a Corvette—it''s good, period.',
  steering_feel = E'Electric power steering with better-than-expected feedback. While not hydraulic-level communication, it''s well-weighted and accurate enough to place the car precisely.\n\nThe quick ratio suits the mid-engine layout. Turn-in response is immediate.',
  brake_confidence = E'Brembo brakes with strong stopping power and excellent fade resistance. The Z51 package adds larger rotors for track capability.\n\nPedal feel is firm and progressive. For a car this fast, the brakes inspire confidence.',
  sound_signature = E'Classic American V8 rumble with a modern edge. The exhaust note is distinctive—deep, mechanical, and aggressive without being obnoxious.\n\nThe sound changes dramatically with driving mode. Quiet enough for neighborhoods in Tour mode; loud enough for drama in Track mode.',
  comfort_track_balance = 'daily',
  comfort_notes = E'The C8 is genuinely comfortable as a daily driver. The Magnetic Ride suspension absorbs rough roads, visibility is excellent for a mid-engine car, and the trunk space (front and rear) is practical.\n\nClimate control works well. The seats are supportive for long drives. It''s a proper GT car that happens to be supercar-fast.',

With 340 horsepower from a 3.4L flat-six and chassis tuned to perfection, it delivered the driving experience enthusiasts had demanded since the Cayman''s introduction.\n\nPorsche''s GTS treatment added meaningful performance: 15 more horsepower, sport exhaust, PASM, and visual enhancements. More importantly, it combined all the right options into one package—no need to navigate the option sheet.\n\nThe 981 generation was the last Cayman with naturally aspirated power. The 718 that followed brought turbocharged four-cylinders (and eventually a flat-six in the GTS 4.0). For purists, the 981 GTS is the ultimate expression of the original Cayman formula.',
  design_philosophy = E'The GTS badge represents Porsche''s sweet spot—more focused than base models but more livable than GT cars.

  heritage = E'The 991.1 Carrera S represents the final chapter of naturally aspirated 911 Carreras. With a 3.8L flat-six producing 400 horsepower, it delivered the visceral, high-revving experience that defined the 911 for decades.\n\nThe 991 generation brought significant changes: longer wheelbase, improved aerodynamics, and more refined chassis. But the engine remained true to 911 tradition—naturally aspirated, responsive, and rewarding.\n\nWhen the 991.2 arrived with standard turbocharging, the 991.1 became the last of its kind. For purists who believe 911s should rev to heaven without forced induction, this is the car.',
  design_philosophy = E'The 991 was designed to be the best 911 ever while remaining true to the formula. The longer wheelbase improved stability. The electric steering provided precise control. The engine remained naturally aspirated because that''s what 911s do.\n\nEvery decision prioritized the driving experience. This wasn''t about lap times or spec-sheet wars—it was about making the driver feel connected to the road.',

The engine sounds mechanical and purposeful, building to a distinctive flat-six wail at redline.\n\nThis is the 911 engine experience that enthusiasts treasure.',
  transmission_feel = E'Manual: The 7-speed manual is controversial—some find 7 gears unnecessary. But it''s well-spaced for both cruising and attacking, with precise shifts and satisfying engagement.\n\nPDK: The 7-speed dual-clutch is brilliant.

  steering_feel = E'Electric power steering arrived with the 991. While not hydraulic, it''s well-calibrated with accurate feedback. You know what the front tires are doing.\n\nPurists preferred the 997''s hydraulic system, but the 991''s electric steering is genuinely good—just different.',
