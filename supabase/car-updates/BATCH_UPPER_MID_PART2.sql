With a hand-ported B18C5 engine revving to 8,400 RPM, the lightest shell possible, and a limited-slip differential, it set the standard for front-wheel-drive performance.\n\nHonda''s Red Badge "Type R" treatment was legendary in Japan—hand-assembly, race-derived components, and uncompromising focus.
