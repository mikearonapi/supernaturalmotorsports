## Image Generation Prompts

### Car Hero Images
```
Professional automotive photography of a {year} {car_name}, 3/4 front angle, {color} color, 
dramatic lighting, cinematic composition, high detail, 8k resolution, Gran Turismo style,
clean background with subtle motion blur, showroom quality

---

## Generation Workflow

1. **Run locally**: Use the prompt templates above with Google AI Studio or API
2. **Save locally**: Save generated images to `generated-images/` folder (gitignored)
3. **Review & Select**: Choose the best generation for each image
4. **Optimize**: Convert to WebP, resize to target dimensions
5. **Upload**: Use Vercel Blob upload (CLI or dashboard)
6. **Update database**: For car images, update `image_hero_url` in Supabase

---

## Vercel Blob Upload

### Via Dashboard
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Blob
2. Upload files maintaining the folder structure
3. Copy public URLs

### Via CLI (recommended for batch)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Upload a file
vercel blob put cars/718-cayman-gt4/hero.webp ./generated-images/718-cayman-gt4-hero.webp

# Or use the upload script (when ready)
node scripts/upload-images.js
```
