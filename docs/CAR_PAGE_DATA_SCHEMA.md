# Car Detail Page - Curated Experience Data Schema

> **Purpose**: This document defines all data fields needed for the new curated car detail pages. Each car in the database should be populated with these fields to provide a rich, educational experience.

---

## Overview: The New Car Page Structure

The redesigned car detail page moves away from "stats presentation" toward **storytelling and education**. Each section tells part of the car's story:

| Section | Purpose | Primary Emotion |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **The Identity** | Who is this car? | Recognition |
| **The Story** | Why does it exist? | Connection |
| **The Driving Experience** | What does it feel like? | Desire |
| **Strengths & Tradeoffs** | The honest truth | Trust |
| **Buyer's Guide** | How to buy smart | Confidence |
| **Ownership Reality** | What it really costs | Preparedness |
| **Track & Performance** | For the enthusiast | Excitement |
| **Alternatives** | Cross-shopping help | Informed decision |
| **Community & Culture** | The ownership experience | Belonging |
| **The Numbers** | Technical reference | Validation |
| **Modification Potential** | For builders | Aspiration |
| **Media & Reviews** | Expert opinions | Confirmation |

### Section 2: The Story

Rich narrative content about the car's history and significance.

```javascript
// NEW FIELDS
heritage: `The GT4 represents Porsche's answer to enthusiasts demanding a naturally aspirated, driver-focused sports car in an era of forced induction. 

Borrowing its 4.0L flat-six from the 911 GT3, it delivers motorsport DNA in a mid-engine package. The 718 generation marked Porsche's return to the flat-six in this chassis after a controversial turbo-four experiment—the GT4 became the halo car that justified the entire 718 line.

First introduced in 2015 on the 981 platform, the second-generation GT4 (2020+) received the larger, more powerful 4.0L engine with 414 hp, cementing its status as one of the most engaging driver's cars of the modern era.`,

designPhilosophy: `Porsche's Motorsport division designed the GT4 with one goal: create the most engaging driving experience possible within the Cayman platform. 

Unlike the base Cayman, which balances comfort and performance, the GT4 sacrifices daily comfort for razor-sharp handling. The suspension is borrowed from the 911 GT3, the brakes are massive steel rotors, and every calibration prioritizes driver feedback over isolation.`,

motorsportHistory: `While not directly raced in factory form, the GT4 shares DNA with the successful Cayman GT4 Clubsport race car. The Clubsport version has competed in SRO GT4 series worldwide, proving the platform's capability at the highest amateur racing level.`,
// ^ Set to null if no motorsport history

culturalImpact: `The GT4 has become a symbol of Porsche's commitment to the driving enthusiast in an era of SUVs and hybrids. It regularly tops "best driver's car" lists and is frequently cited as a future collectible.`,
// ^ Movies, famous owners, cultural moments. null if not applicable

notableAccomplishments: [
  "Motor Trend Best Driver's Car finalist 2020",
  "Car and Driver 10Best 2021",
  "Nürburgring lap time: 7:28.2 (factory claim)"
],
// ^ Records, awards, achievements

predecessors: ["981 Cayman GT4 (2015-2016)"],
successors: ["982 Cayman GT4 RS (2022+)"],
// ^ Earlier and later models in the lineage
```

### Section 3: The Driving Experience

Paragraph-form descriptions of what the car feels like to drive.

```javascript
// NEW FIELDS
engineCharacter: `The 4.0L flat-six rewards RPMs like few modern engines can. Below 4,000 RPM it's civilized and tractable; above 5,000, it transforms into a wailing instrument that begs for redline.

Peak power arrives at 8,000 RPM—an eternity beyond most turbocharged competitors—and the linear power delivery means you're always in control. There's no boost threshold, no waiting for turbos to spool. Just pure, mechanical response.

The intake howl is addictive. Every downshift through a tunnel becomes an event.`,

transmissionFeel: `The six-speed manual has one of the best shift actions in any modern car—short throws, mechanical precision, perfect weighting. You'll find yourself shifting just for the tactile satisfaction.

Rev-matching is standard but can be disabled for those who prefer heel-toe. The clutch is heavier than a base Cayman but perfectly weighted for spirited driving. The PDK option is lightning-fast but most enthusiasts agree the manual is the soul of this car.`,

chassisDynamics: `The GT4's chassis is its party piece. Turn-in is immediate, rotation is adjustable, and the mid-engine balance means you can play with oversteer and understeer at will.

The rear-biased weight distribution (46/54) makes the car eager to rotate, but never snappy or unpredictable. Push hard through a corner and the rear will gently step out, telegraphing its limits clearly. It's a car that rewards aggression while remaining approachable.

Body roll is minimal but the ride isn't punishing—it walks the line between track weapon and weekend canyon carver beautifully.`,

steeringFeel: `Electric power steering done right. The GT4's rack is quicker than standard Caymans and offers genuine feedback—you feel the road surface, the tire loading, and the exact moment of breakaway.

At parking speeds it's light enough. At speed, it weights up naturally. It's not quite hydraulic-era feel, but it's closer than most modern cars dare to get.`,

brakeConfidence: `The stock brakes are track-capable for most drivers. 380mm front rotors with six-piston calipers provide strong initial bite and excellent modulation.

After 20-30 minutes of hard track use, fade becomes noticeable with stock pads. For serious track days, upgraded pads are the first modification most owners make. The brake pedal feel is firm and progressive—you always know exactly how much stopping power you're commanding.`,

soundSignature: `The flat-six has a distinctive bark that sets it apart from inline-sixes and V8s. It's mechanical, not synthesized—no fake engine notes here.

At idle, a purposeful burble. At mid-RPM, a rising howl. At redline, a full-throated scream that Porsche enthusiasts will recognize instantly. The exhaust has a rasp to it that sounds expensive and angry.

With the windows down in a tunnel, it's genuinely addictive.`,

comfortTrackBalance: "track-focused",
// ^ "daily" | "weekend" | "track-focused" | "race"

comfortNotes: `This is not a comfortable daily driver. The suspension is firm, road noise is present, and the fixed-back buckets (optional but common) aren't designed for long commutes.

That said, it's not punishing either. For weekend use and spirited driving, the tradeoffs are worth it. Just don't expect to arrive at work without some fatigue on rough roads.`
